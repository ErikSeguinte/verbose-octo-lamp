# Goals

## Minimum Functionality

- ~~Let me create a “calendar” that goes from Time A to Time B, with days broken down into ½ hour slots~~
- ~~have a shareable link I can send to people that’s unique to each event~~
- accept input from multiple different people on different computers that gets labeled with their name
- ~~allow the user to select the timezone they’re in, with the times/days adjusted to that time zone~~
- allow those people to indicate which blocks of time they are available.
- Display each individual input on its own on the calendar when selected
- Allow me to select multiple individuals, and show the time slots where their availability overlaps

## Extended Functionality

- Alphabetize the list of people who have turned in their availability (this especially. Please.)
- Indicate if all but one of the people selected are available for a time slot
- Be easily useable on mobile

## Stretch Goals

- Allow me to edit the event calendar after the fact, extending the time it covers
- Allow users to edit their availability
- export directly to a google calendar

## Visual Targets

- day of the week indicated
- ~~day/date at top, times in a vertical column downward (I like the whenisgood layout for that)~~
- Ideally, display the time zone the calendar is currently using in really big font at the top somewhere.
- Obvious and easy to find place to change the time zone.

      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
